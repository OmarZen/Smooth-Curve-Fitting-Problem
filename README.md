Assignment 2 – Smooth Curve Fitting Problem
About the problem:
Curve fitting is the process of constructing a
curve, or mathematical function (polynomial
equation) that has the best fit to a series of data
points, possibly subject to constraints. In smooth
curve fitting, the function is constructed to
approximately fit the data. Given a set of points,
we would like to fit a curve to them using a
polynomial equation.
What you are required to do:
Write a genetic algorithm to find the best coefficients that would make the distance
between the polynomial function and the points minimum. (A solved example is
provided in lab Floating point genetic algorithms)
What the input looks like:
You’ll be given an input file with the following format:
• First line: Number of datasets (must be at least 1)
For each dataset:
• Number of data points and polynomial degree separated by space
For each point:
• x-coordinate and y-coordinate separated by space
